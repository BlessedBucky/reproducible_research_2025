### Exercise 0

Open up the terminal\
Pick a space for your reproducible research materials and navigate there



Create a new folder named `RR_2`
```
mkdir RR_2
```

Navigate to your new folder
```
cd RR_2
```

Create a classes.txt file with a line with today's date.
```
echo "04/03/2024" > classes.txt
```
### Basic git commands

`git, git --help` to display git inline help\
`git [cmd] --help` to display web help about cmd\
`git --version` to display diagnostic info (version)\
`git status` to display local repository status\
`git log` to display history of commits

`git init [repo_name]` to initialize an empty repository in the current [or specified] directory\
`git clone [repo_name] [clone_name]` to create a linked copy of a repository

`git config -l` to view all configuration options

Config structure: `git config [-l] [--scope] [option_name] [value]`

There are three levels of configuration (i.e. scope):\
`--system` - pertains to repositories of all system users\
`--global` - pertains to all user's repositories, overrides system settings\
`--local` (default) - pertains to the current repository, overrides global settings

Note: global configuration will be visible only if you've used Git before (and added some options)\
Note 2: local configuraiton will be visible only if we're in a Git repository

```
git config -l --local
```
### Exercise 1

In your `RR_2` directory, initiate a git repository named `EX1` and enter it\
(hint: you can either initiate it with that name, or create a folder named `EX1`, enter it, and initiate the repository inside)
```
git init EX1
cd EX1
```
or
```
mkdir EX1
cd EX1
git init
```
List all available configuration options.
```
git config -l
```
List all global options
```
git config -l --global
```
(Note: this will only work if you've ever changed any global options)\

List all local options
```
git config -l --local
```
Set global option `'user.name'` to your name
```
git config --global user.name "Name Surname"
```
Set global option `'user.email'` to your e-mail
```
git config --global user.email "your.email@smth.smth"
```
List all global options, check the difference
```
git config -l --global
```
Set local option `'user.name'` to your initials
```
git config --local user.name "AB"
```
List all local options
```
git config -l --local
```

`git add [filename(s)]` to add files to the staging area\
`git add .` to add all new/modified files to the staging area\
`git commit -m "<commit description>"` to create a new commit with what's in the staging area

At any point you can:\
`git status` to verify where you are, and what are the differences between the three trees\
`git diff` to compare last commit with what's in the working directory\
`git log` to view the commit history

### Exercise 2

In your `RR_2` directory, initiate a git repository named `EX2` and enter it
```
cd ..
git init EX2
cd EX2
```
Create a file named `README.md`, add a single line of text inside, save the file [hint: you can use echo or create it manually with e.g. Notepad]
```
touch README.md
echo "one line" >> README.md
```
(check `git status` and `git diff` to get a better feel of this)

Stage the new file.
```
git add README.md
```
Commit the file (remember to include a helpful commit description!)
```
git commit -m "Added README.md with one line of text"
```
(check `git status` and `git diff` and `git log` to get a better feel of this)\

### Exercise 3

Add another line of text to the file you created.
```
echo "a second line" >> README.md
```
Create a new file named `readme.txt`.
```
touch readme.txt
```
Create an empty folder named `data`
```
mkdir data
```
Run the repository diagnostics as above.
```
git status
```
Stage and commit the modifed file and the new file.
```
git add .
git commit -m "Modified README.md and added readme.txt"
```
Check git log, etc. again.
```
git log
git status
```
### Exercise 4

using `.gitignore`\
Create `data/data1.csv` file and fill it with a random data line (can be just comma-separated text, it doesn't matter), check status and diff

Create a `.gitignore` file (yes, starting with a dot), put the `data` inside (it's the name of our directory), check status and diff\
`.gitignore` is a file that tells git to ignore certain elements. Should we commit it? <- depends on the workflow and, e.g., who we're working with (we might not want to share it with collaborators)



## Assignment:
While in your `EX2` repository, run these four commands:
```
git status
git log
git ls-files
git ls-files -o
```
Copy the contents of Bash/CLI starting from git status and send them to me in a notepad file (j.michankow@uw.edu.pl).

Try to store your files in a safe place so we can pick up where we left next time.
